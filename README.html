<h1 id="matbot:apersonaltwitterbot.brnotparticularlyusefulbutfun...">matbot: a personal twitter bot.<br>not particularly useful, but fun&#8230;</h1>

<p><strong>matbot</strong> was an exercise I assigned myself as a way to learn to read &amp; edit Python code and deploy my first application using Git and a cloud based hosting platform (Heroku, in this case).</p>

<p>The bot is autonomous and tweets several times per day on subjects limited almost exclusively to web and graphic design.</p>

<p>In many ways the bot is satire, half-heartedly marketing itself in the way that web designers tend to do; by aggregating and reposting advice and wisdom culled from other web sources who are, more than likely, doing the same.</p>

<p>The initial pre-planning for this project was minimal. I based the twitter bot off of <a href="https://github.com/tommeagher/heroku_ebooks">Tom Meagher&#8217;s heroku_ebooks repo</a> (which itself was based off the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/-horse-ebooks-is-the-most-successful-piece-of-cyber-fiction-ever/279946/">@Horse_Ebooks</a> project).</p>

<p>The <strong>matbot</strong> logo was designed by me in Adobe Illustrator to represent the overall harmless nature of the bot.</p>

<p>A monospaced typeface seemed like the best choice for this project due to the subject matter (bots). Also, for purposes of repetition and alliteration, mat bot dot net stacks nicely in monospace.</p>

<h1 id="thehomepage">The homepage</h1>

<p>Presentation of the bot outside of Twitter was a last minute decision, with the first website coded in Sublime without a layout plan in mind other than to emphasize the tweets and link to additional social media accounts:</p>

<p>The first <strong>matbot</strong> homepage emphasizes the Twitter feed and provides links to additional social media accounts. Vague, primitive graphics suggest an early video game.</p>

<p>As time went on the project left my mind, escept for a few occasional check-ins, but during the process of moving all my domains and hosting packages I decided the bot&#8217;s website could use some sprucing up.</p>

<p>The updated <strong>matbot</strong> homepage is interactive (interactivity of the site is made possible by the <a href="https://interactjs.io/">interact.js</a> library), and attempts to create a Zen Garden experience.</p>

<p>Simple ornaments can be re-positioned to form simple, peaceful arrangements.</p>

<h2 id="thetwitteraccount">The Twitter Account</h2>

<p>To date, the <a href="https://twitter.com/_matbot">@_matbot twitter account</a> has tweeted over 11,000 times. I no longer have the credentials to change any of the settings of the app, so it will continue as long as Twitter exists (or until it gets shutdown for being a bot)</p>

<small>Fig7. - @_matbot tweets automatically, 3–7 times each day, plus a reminder of the current date every afternoon at 2:30pm, eastern US time. </small></p>

<h2 id="thefacebookaccount">The Facebook Account</h2>

<p>There is a <strong>matbot</strong> Facebook page that also posts multiple times per day. The facebook posts mirror matbot&#8217;s tweets, triggered by an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT Applet</a></p>
