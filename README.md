# matbot: a personal twitter bot.<br>not particularly useful, but fun... #

__matbot__ was an exercise I assigned myself as a way to learn to read & edit Python code and deploy my first application using Git and a cloud based hosting platform.

The bot is autonomous and tweets several times per day on subjects limited almost exclusively to web and graphic design. In some ways the bot is satire, half-heartedly marketing itself in the way that web designers tend to do; by aggregating and reposting advice and wisdom culled from other web sources who are, more than likely, doing the same.

The __matbot__ logo was designed by me to represent the overall harmless nature of the bot.

## Sketches and Wireframes

Pre-planning for this project was minimal. I based the project files off of Tom Meagher's GitHub repository (which itself was based off the horse e-books project), but presentation of the bot outside of Twitter was a last minute decision, coded in Sublime with no real layout plan in mind other than to emphasize the tweets and link to additional social media accounts.

<small>Fig1. - The matbot homepage emphasizes the Twitter feed and provides links to additional social media accounts. Vague, primitive graphics suggest an early video game.</small>

## Typography

### SPACE MONO
![matbot font](https://github.com/discoform/matbot/blob/master/images/font-stack.png "matbot font")
A monospaced typeface seemed like the best choice for this project due to the subject matter (bots). Also, for purposes of repetition and alliteration, mat bot dot net stacks nicely in monospace:
